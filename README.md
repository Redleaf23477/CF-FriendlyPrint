# CF-FriendlyPrint
Friendly Print for codeforces problem and tutorial.

Some javascripts to print codeforces problems and tutorials without sidebar, top menu, ... etc.

Hope to pack it to chrome extension.

## Problems to be solved

Codeforces tutorials does not have an uniformed format, making it difficult to select which problems (which `<div>` tags) to print.
